## Updated skip button design

The skip button was sitting in a weird place on the screen, so we decided to throw it away and [start fresh](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/801). The new one features a countdown bar and a much larger hit area. It also gets out of your way when you're busy watching amazing storyboards.

<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/2ydkj/xfwxwe" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>

Note that the sound effect is missing in this video for whatever reason. Go download lazer if you wanna try it yourself :).
