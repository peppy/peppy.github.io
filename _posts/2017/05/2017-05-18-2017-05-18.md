Quite some good progress today! Let's dive into it.

## Updated spinner design

The lazer spinner design was nothing short of temporary. It was laggy to boot. Today I spent a [great deal of time](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/791) realising flyte's newer design in full detail. Take a look at it isolated:

<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/ya3f1/agegle" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>

and in a map:

<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/hx61n/niuhzc" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>

Note that due to some deficiencies in our framework regarding how glows are rendered, the colours are *not correct* and *not final*. It will ook much more vibrant once these issues are addressed:
