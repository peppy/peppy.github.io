- Coloured bar on the left represents the difficulty level at a quick glance.
- The source and artist are in the correct place now.
- The weird double-dash is replaced with an em-dash as expected.

## Online metrics are now loaded

You will now be able to see beatmap fail/retry times and online ratings if you are logged in. They are cached only until you exit song select once, but will definitely be cached for longer in the future. You'll notice the display dim while it's fetching new values from the intertubes.

## Rigid body physics

[Tom94](https://github.com/Tom94) seems to have gotten a bit restless while on vacation and implemented the basics of rigis body physics simulation in osu-framework (see [#656](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/656))! I won't even begin to pretend that I understand the [math behind this](http://i.imgur.com/LVf7d4d.png), but the implementation looks pretty solid.

Not sure how often we will use this in the case of osu!, but at very least the fail animations could be a lot more interesting than before!
