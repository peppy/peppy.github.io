Good evening.

Preparations continue for our space at Anime Expo 2017 throughout this week. I've been working around the clock (literally, due to opposite time zones!) to organise all the furnishing, electricity, PCs and other gear that we need to make ths event space happen. Stay hyped, because we're not cutting corners as far as making the osu! space as enjoyable as possible for everyone that attends!

In the spirit of the upcoming 10 years of osu!, let me give you a little present.

Oh, we've also made quite a bit of forward lazer progress in a few departments, so let's get into that!

## [OSD support for Raw Input and Cursor Sensitivity](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/920)

When changing cursor sensitivity or toggling raw input, you will now see the current status popup in the OSD. It also gives you a handy tip that you can now hit `Ctrl+Alt+R` to completely reset the settings, in case you make a mistake and are unable to control your game input.

Implemented by myself, requiring [some amount](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/807) of [framework changes](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/809) to get the reset part working correctly.

## [Very simplistic implementation of the Social Browser](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/859)

Currently has nowhere near the functionality we will see in the final implementation, and only displays top-ranked players, but it's a stepping stone towards the final goal!

Thanks to DrabWeb for his great work modularising these overlays so code can be shared between them all.
